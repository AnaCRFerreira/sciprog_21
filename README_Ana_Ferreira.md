This repository is dedicated to uploading the resolution of the practical lessons.

Each folder correspond to one week practical, starting on week 2 (_practical02_) and finishing in week 10 
(_practical10_).

Additionally, each folder contains its _README_ file, that should be read to understand what is the content of 
that week, and how to run the code.

For any questions please contact me through email: _ana.ferreira@tyndall.ie_
