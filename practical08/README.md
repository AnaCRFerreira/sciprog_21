# gcd.c

_gcd.c_ uses an iterative and recursive versions of Euclid's Algorithm to 
calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. It requires the user o 
enter two integers.

To run:
```
gcc -o gcd gcd.c
./gcd
``` 

# autoGCD.c

_autoGCD.c_ uses an iterative and recursive versions of Euclid's Algorithm to
calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers. These two positive integers 
are randomly generated between 1 and 12.

To run:
```
gcc -o autoGCD autoGCD.c
./autoGCD
```
